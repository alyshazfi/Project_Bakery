# Project_Bakery
This is my final project for Object Oriented Programming Subject and in this project, i used Java GUI to run the program.
/n
The main idea of the program is to calculate the total of the transaction in a bakery. The program will return the total of the transaction and a simple printed receipt of the transaction.
